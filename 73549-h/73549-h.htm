<h1>How It Feels
to Be Colored Me</h1>

<p><i>I am colored but I offer nothing</i>
in the way of extenuating circumstances
except the fact that I
am the only Negro in the United
States whose grandfather on the
mother’s side was not an Indian
chief.</p>

<p>I remember the very day
that I became colored. Up to my
thirteenth year I lived in the
little Negro town of Eatonville,
Florida. It is exclusively a colored
town. The only white people I
knew passed through the town
going to or coming from Orlando.
The native whites rode dusty
horses, the Northern tourists
chugged down the sandy village
road in automobiles. The town
knew the Southerners and never
stopped cane chewing when they
passed. But the Northerners were
something else again. They were
peered at cautiously from behind
curtains by the timid. The more
venturesome would come out on
the porch to watch them go past
and got just as much pleasure out
of the tourists as the tourists got
out of the village.</p>

<p>The front porch might seem
a daring place for the rest of the
town, but it was a gallery seat for
me. My favorite place was atop
the gate-post. Proscenium box for
a born first-nighter. Not only did I
enjoy the show, but I didn’t mind
the actors knowing that I liked it.
I usually spoke to them in passing.
I’d wave at them and when
they returned my salute, I would
say something like this: “Howdy-do-well-I-thank-you-where-you-go-in’?”
Usually automobile or
the horse paused at this, and after
a queer exchange of compliments,
I would probably “go a piece of
the way” with them, as we say in
farthest Florida. If one of my family
happened to come to the front
in time to see me, of course negotiations
would be rudely broken
off. But even so, it is clear that
I was the first “welcome-to-our-state”
Floridian, and I hope the
Miami Chamber of Commerce
will please take notice.</p>

<p>During this period, white people
differed from colored to me
only in that they rode through
town and never lived there. They
liked to hear me “speak pieces”
and sing and wanted to see me
dance the parse-me-la, and gave me
generously of their small silver for
doing these things, which seemed
strange to me for I wanted to do
them so much that I needed bribing
to stop, only they didn’t know
it. The colored people gave no
dimes. They deplored any joyful
tendencies in me, but I was their
Zora nevertheless. I belonged to
them, to the nearby hotels, to the
county—everybody’s Zora.</p>

<p>But changes came in the family
when I was thirteen, and I was
sent to school in Jacksonville. I
left Eatonville, the town of the
oleanders, as Zora. When I disembarked
from the river-boat at
Jacksonville, she was no more. It
seemed that I had suffered a sea
change. I was not Zora of Orange
County any more, I was now a little
colored girl. I found it out in
certain ways. In my heart as well
as in the mirror, I became a fast
brown—warranted not to rub nor
run.</p>

<p>But I am not tragically colored.
There is no great sorrow dammed
up in my soul, nor lurking behind
my eyes. I do not mind at all. I
do not belong to the sobbing
school of Negrohood who hold
that nature somehow has given
them a lowdown dirty deal and
whose feelings are all but about
it. Even in the helter-skelter skirmish
that is my life, I have seen
that the world is to the strong
regardless of a little pigmentation
more or less. No, I do not weep at
the world—I am too busy sharpening
my oyster knife.</p>

<p>Someone is always at my
elbow reminding me that I am the
granddaughter of slaves. It fails
to register depression with me.
Slavery is sixty years in the past.
The operation was successful and
the patient is doing well, thank
you. The terrible struggle that
made me an American out of a
potential slave said “On the line!”
The Reconstruction said “Get
set!” and the generation before
said “Go!” I am off to a flying start
and I must not halt in the stretch
to look behind and weep. Slavery
is the price I paid for civilization,
and the choice was not with me.
It is a bully adventure and worth
all that I have paid through my
ancestors for it. No one on earth
ever had a greater chance for
glory. The world to be won and
nothing to be lost. It is thrilling
to think—to know that for any act
of mine, I shall get twice as much
praise or twice as much blame. It
is quite exciting to hold the center
of the national stage, with the
spectators not knowing whether
to laugh or to weep.</p>

<p>The position of my white
neighbor is much more difficult.
No brown specter pulls up a chair
beside me when I sit down to
eat. No dark ghost thrusts its leg
against mine in bed. The game of
keeping what one has is never so
exciting as the game of getting.</p>

<p>I do not always feel colored.
Even now I often achieve the
unconscious Zora of Eatonville
before the Hegira. I feel most colored
when I am thrown against a
sharp white background.</p>

<p>For instance at Barnard. “Beside
the waters of the Hudson” I
feel my race. Among the thousand
white persons, I am a dark rock
surged upon, and overswept, but
through it all, I remain myself.
When covered by the waters, I
am; and the ebb but reveals me
again.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is the other
way around. A white person is
set down in our midst, but the
contrast is just as sharp for me.
For instance, when I sit in the
drafty basement that is The New
World Cabaret with a white
person, my color comes. We enter
chatting about any little nothing
that we have in common and are
seated by the jazz waiters. In the
abrupt way that jazz orchestras
have, this one plunges into a number.
It loses no time in circumlocutions,
but gets right down to
business. It constricts the thorax
and splits the heart with its tempo
and narcotic harmonies. This
orchestra grows rambunctious,
rears on its hind legs and attacks
the tonal veil with primitive
fury, rending it, clawing it until
it breaks through to the jungle
beyond. I follow those heathen—follow
them exultingly. I dance
wildly inside myself; I yell within,
I whoop; I shake my assegai
above my head, I hurl it true to
the mark yeeeeooww! I am in the
jungle and living in the jungle
way. My face is painted red and
yellow and my body is painted
blue. My pulse is throbbing like
a war drum. I want to slaughter
something—give pain, give death
to what, I do not know. But the
piece ends. The men of the orchestra
wipe their lips and rest their
fingers. I creep back slowly to the
veneer we call civilization with
the last tone and find the white
friend sitting motionless in his
seat, smoking calmly.</p>

<p>“Good music they have
here,” he remarks, drumming the
table with his fingertips.</p>

<p>Music. The great blobs of
purple and red emotion have not
touched him. He has only heard
what I felt. He is far away and
I see him but dimly across the
ocean and the continent that have
fallen between us. He is so pale
with his whiteness then and I am
so colored.</p>

<p>At certain times I have no
race, I am me. When I set my
hat at a certain angle and saunter
down Seventh Avenue, Harlem
City, feeling as snooty as the
lions in front of the Forty-Second
Street Library, for instance. So
far as my feelings are concerned,
Peggy Hopkins Joyce on the Boule
Mich with her gorgeous raiment,
stately carriage, knees knocking
together in a most aristocratic
manner, has nothing on me. The
cosmic Zora emerges. I belong to
no race nor time. I am the eternal
feminine with its string of beads.</p>

<p>I have no separate feeling
about being an American citizen
and colored. I am merely a fragment
of the Great Soul that surges
within the boundaries. My country,
right or wrong.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I feel discriminated
against, but it does not make me
angry. It merely astonishes me.
How can any deny themselves
the pleasure of my company? It’s
beyond me.</p>

<p>But in the main, I feel like a
brown bag of miscellany propped
against a wall. Against a wall in
company with other bags, white,
red and yellow. Pour out the
contents, and there is discovered
a jumble of small things priceless
and worthless. A first-water
diamond, an empty spool, bits of
broken glass, lengths of string, a
key to a door long since crumbled
away, a rusty knife-blade, old
shoes saved for a road that never
was and never will be, a nail
bent under the weight of things
too heavy for any nail, a dried
flower or two still a little fragrant.
In your hand is the brown
bag. On the ground before you
is the jumble it held—so much
like the jumble in the bags could
they be emptied that all might be
dumped in a single heap and the
bags refilled without altering the
content of any greatly. A bit of
colored glass more or less would
not matter. Perhaps that is how
the Great Stuffer of Bags filled
them in the first place—who
knows?
